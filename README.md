# Retinal vessel segmentation
I am currently taking the fastai deep learning course: https://course.fast.ai/

Current progress: end of lecture 2

In this project I am trying to implement what I have learned in the first two lectures of the course and build an image segmentation model using fastai/PyTorch and deploy the model to hugging face spaces using Gradio.

As training data I am using three published retina image data sets which have been combined and uploaded to Kaggle by Noob Data Scientist.

I will continue working on this project as I progress in the course and try to improve the model performance.
